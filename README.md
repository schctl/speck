## Usage

### Installation

Speck is packaged publicly on PyPi as [`speck-wrapper`](https://pypi.org/project/speck-wrapper/) *(don't confuse with [`speck`](https://pypi.org/project/speck/))*.

    pip install speck-wrapper

To install from source, first clone the repository.

    git clone https://github.com/schctl/speck.git

Then, from the root directory, run

    pip install .

### GUI Frontend

The `speck` library must be installed for this to work, in addition to requirements listed in `app/requirements.txt`.

    pip install -r app/requirements.txt

To run the speck app, run `main.py` under `app`.

    cd app && python main.py

The username and password entry screen is only intended as a dummy. To make the app ignore this,
set the `SPECK_DEV` environment variable. The username and password are `11C` and `11c2021`.

## City Data

City data is from [`cities.json`](https://github.com/lutangar/cities.json), and has been edited to remove irrelevant data.
