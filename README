# Speck

Minimal wrapper and frontend for weatherAPI.com.

    https://www.weatherapi.com/

This project isn't intended to be state-of-the-art or educational, rather, a "just works" implementation,
mostly constrained by what's part of the syllabus (except the use of classes). Speck intends to show
usage of git, versioning, and common practices used in open source projects. It intends to
have a well documented API and have thoroughly commented implementations and
also has a repository hosted on GitHub.

## Notes

- Some weatherAPI implementations have not been tested, due to time constraints. These need to be tested:
  - [ ] Search and Autocomplete API
  - [ ] IP lookup API
  - [ ] History API
  - [ ] Sports API
