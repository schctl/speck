# Speck

Minimal wrapper and frontend for weatherAPI.com.

    https://www.weatherapi.com/

Speck's focus isn't practicality, rather, to show use of version control, and other common
practices used in open source projects. It intends to have a well documented API and have
thoroughly commented implementations. It also has a repository hosted on GitHub.

## City Data

City data is from cities.json, and has been edited to remove irrelevant data.

    https://github.com/lutangar/cities.json

## Requirements

Install requirements by running:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Additionally, tkinter is required.

## Usage

Run the frontend with

    python ui_main.py

The username and password entry screen is only intended as a dummy. To bypass this, set the `SPECK_DEV` environment variable.

## Notes

- Some weatherAPI implementations have not been tested, due to time constraints. These need to be tested:
  - [ ] Search and Autocomplete API
  - [ ] IP lookup API
  - [ ] History API
  - [ ] Sports API
