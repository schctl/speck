# Speck

Minimal wrapper and frontend for weatherAPI.com.

    https://www.weatherapi.com/

This project isn't intended to be state-of-the-art or educational, rather, a "just works" implementation, mostly constrained by what's part of the syllabus (except the use of classes). Speck also intends to show usage of git, and common practices
used in projects. Speck also has a repository hosted on GitHub.

## City Data

City data is from [cities.json](https://github.com/lutangar/cities.json), and has been edited to remove irrelevant data.


## Requirements

Install requirements by running:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Additionally, [tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) is required.


## Notes

- Some weatherAPI implementations have not been tested, due to time constraints. These need to be tested:
  - [ ] Search and Autocomplete API
  - [ ] IP lookup API
  - [ ] History API
  - [ ] Sports API
