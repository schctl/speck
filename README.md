**__Usage__**

`speck` can be imported as a regular python module after installation.

    >>> help(speck)

## GUI Frontend

**__Installation__**

Install scripts in `scripts` will automate the install for you.

**__Manual installation__**

The `speck` library must be installed for this to work, in addition to requirements listed in `app/requirements.txt`.

    pip install -r app/requirements.txt

**__Usage__**

To run the speck app, run `main.py` under `app`.

    cd app && python main.py

The username and password entry screen is a dummy. To make the app ignore this, set the `SPECK_DEV` environment variable. The username and password are `11C` and `11c2021`.
