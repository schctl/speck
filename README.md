# speck

`speck` is a minimal weather app and library to interact with [weatherapi.com]. It was created by
[Sachin Cherian](https://github.com/schctl/) and [Nevin Jose](https://github.com/FaZe-Vulcan/)
as their 12th grade Computer Science project and showcases some concepts in Python and
some popular development ideas.

Some of the main ideas demonstrated are:
- Usage of functions and classes in Python
- Using packages and modules in Python to separate functionality in code
- Distributing code as packages
- Retrieving and storing data from a remote source
- Serving that data using a GUI toolkit such as [Tkinter], and visualization with [matplotlib]
- Using [Version Control] software like [git] to keep track of development and help with collaboration.

See the [Wiki] for more documentation on some concepts.

## Usage

### The speck library

Speck is packaged publicly on PyPi as [`speck-wrapper`]

```
pip install speck-wrapper
```

Alternatively, to install from source, first clone the repository and then use `pip` to install it.

```
git clone https://github.com/schctl/speck.git
cd speck
pip install .
```

`speck` can then be imported as a regular python module.

```py
>>> import speck
>>> help(speck)
```

### GUI Frontend

The `speck` library must be installed for this to work, in addition to requirements listed in `app/requirements.txt`.

```
# From the repository's root directory
pip install -r app/requirements.txt
```

To run the speck app, run `main.py` under `app`.

```
cd app && python main.py
```

The username and password entry screen is a dummy. The username and password are `11C` and `11c2021`.
Set the `SPECK_DEV` environment variable to make the app ignore the login screen.
